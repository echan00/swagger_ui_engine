  <h1>API Reference</h1>
  <p>The TranslateFX API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies encoded in UTF-8, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.</p>
  <p>The TranslateFX API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. Sign in to see docs customized to your version of the API.</p>
  <p>Below are your API versions:</p>
  <% @swagger_url.each_key do |k| %>

      <h1> <%= link_to k, swagger_doc_path(k) %> </h1>
    </li>
  <% end %>
